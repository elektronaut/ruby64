# Ruby64

Ruby64 is a Commodore 64 emulator in written in Ruby. It is cycle accurate,
utilizing Fibers to emulate cycles.

Currently the memory map and 6510 CPU is working, sans
interrupts. It's running at about 10% of the original speed, Ruby is
currently too slow for realtime performance. SID emulation is probably
also out of the question.

## TODO

- Interrupts
- VIC-II emulation
- CIA 1/2
- C1541 emulation
